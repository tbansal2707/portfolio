description : As an Operations Research Intern at Dematic, I work with a team of engineers and analysts to design, implement, and test optimization models and algorithms for various logistics and supply chain problems. I use my skills in Data analysis to manipulate, analyze, and visualize large and complex data sets, and to develop and deploy scalable and robust solutions with tools in the fields of Optimisation and Machine Learning. I am also a Master's graduate in Data Science from The University of Texas at Austin. During my B.Tech., I also gained a strong foundation in Operation Research as well as a Minor Degree in Business management from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. I have a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, and I co-founded a company at the age of 21 that generated over $7 million in revenue in one year, by developing and delivering novel designs and operational strategy in the bicycle sector. I am looking to leverage my skills and experience in a role that optimizes operations and/or builds machine learning algorithms.
