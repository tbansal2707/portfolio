description : Hi, Welcome to my portfolio! As an Operations Research Intern at Dematic, I work with a team of engineers to design, implement, and test optimization algorithms for various supply chain problems. I use my skills in Data Analysis to manipulate, analyze, and visualize large and complex data sets, and to develop and deploy scalable and robust algorithms with tools in the fields of Optimisation and Machine Learning. I co-founded a company at the age of 21 that generated over $7 million in revenue in one year. I am looking to leverage my skills and experience in a role that optimizes operations and/or builds machine learning algorithms.
